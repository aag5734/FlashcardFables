# FlashcardFables

FlashcardFables is a Java project that aims to make studying fun by combining the concept of flashcards with an adventurous game. In this game, players are given spell cards with terms on them, and they will encounter enemies marked with definitions. To defeat the enemies and progress in the game, players must choose the correct spell card (the term linked with the enemy's definition). To master each card, players must successfully defeat enemies using the same card five times.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** The main objective of FlashcardFables is to defeat enemies using the correct spell cards (terms) associated with the enemy's definition.

2. **Getting Started:** Upon starting the game, players will be prompted to enter the path of a text file containing the spell card data. The text file should be formatted with each line containing a term and its corresponding definition separated by a tab ("\t").

3. **Game Mechanics:**

   - Encounter: As the player progresses through the game, they will encounter enemies marked with definitions. Each enemy will have one correct spell card (term) associated with their definition.

   - Choosing a Spell Card: Players must choose the correct spell card (term) that matches the enemy's definition in order to defeat the enemy.

   - Battling Enemies: Upon choosing a spell card, the player will engage in a battle with the enemy. If the selected spell card is correct, the player wins the battle and gains familiarity with the card. If the selected card is incorrect, the player loses the battle and the enemy may deal damage to the player.

   - Mastering Cards: To fully master a card, the player must successfully defeat five enemies using the same spell card.

4. **Game Progression:** Players will progress through the game by exploring different areas and encountering various enemies. The difficulty level may increase as the player advances, requiring them to remember and correctly use a wider range of spell cards.

5. **Winning the Game:** The game ends when the player successfully masters all the spell cards by defeating five enemies with each card.
