Horizontal Scaling	Adding more servers to the pool to meet increased demand
Message Broker	A piece of middleware responsible for routing and communicating messages
Point-to-point Messaging	A message broker distribution pattern that represents a one-to-one relationship between the message's sender and receiver. Each message in the queue is sent to only one recipient and is consumed only once.
Publish/Subscribe Messaging	A message broker distribution pattern where message queues have a one-to-many relationship with the message sender (publisher) and the receiver (subscriber).
Load Balancing	The methodical and efficient distribution of requests across multiple servers
Round Robin	Static. A load balancing algorithm that distributes traffic across servers equally, despite specs
Weighted Round Robin	Static. A load balancing algorithm that assigns more requests to the server with a higher capability of handling a greater load
Least Connection	Dynamic. A load balancing algorithm that takes into consideration the number of current connections each server has and connects a client with the server that has the least number of connections
Weighted Least Connection	Dynamic. A load balancing algorithm that takes into consideration the weights/capacities of each server and the number of connections.
Random	Static. A load balancing algorithm that maps requests to servers using an underlying random number generator.
Distributed Caching	A cache that pools together the RAM of multiple networked computers into a single in-memory data store used as a data cache to provide fast access to data
Peer-to-Peer Computing	Each machine is a node that acts as a client and a server. All users contribute and consume resources within the network.
Centralized P2P	A P2P system that mixes the features of both centralized and decentralized architectures. One or more central serves that help peers locate their desired resources or act as tasks schedulers to coordinate actions among them.
Decentralized P2P	A P2P system in which peers have equal rights/responsibilities.
Decentralized Unstructured P2P	A P2P system in which each peer is responsible for its own data and keeps track of a set of neighbors to whom it may forward queries
Decentralized Structured P2P	A P2P system where there is no mapping between data and peers; instead, a distributed hash table is used for data placement.
Distributed Hash Tables	Used for organizing nodes and indexing data. They store key/value pairs for all peers
Chord DHT	A protocol and algorithm for a P2P DHT that uses consistent hashing. This is used to balance the load on the network since each node receives roughly the same number of keys and requires little movement of keys when nodes join/leave the system
Routing Table	A table used in a P2P networking system that contains nodes that have an ID value and IP address
Stabilization Protocol	An algorithm that periodically updates finger tables of affected nodes and successor pointers
Parallel Computing	The simultaneous use of multiple computing resources to solve a problem
Flynn's Taxonomy	Taxonomy that classifies parallel computer architectures along the two independent dimensions of Instruction Stream and Data Stream
Single Instruction / Single Data Stream (SISD)	A non-parallel computer. Oldest type of computer with deterministic execution
Single Instruction / Multiple Data Stream (SIMD)	A type of parallel computer. Best suited for specialized programs characterized by a high degree of regularity.
Multiple Instruction / Single Data Stream (MISD)	A type of parallel computer. A single data stream is fed into multiple cores
Multiple Instruction / Multiple Data Stream (MIMD)	Every processor may be executing a different instruction set and every professor may be working with a different data stream. Execution could be async or sync
Multicore Hyper-Threading	A type of parallel computing hardware in which more than one thread can run on each core.
GPU Accelerated	A type of parallel computing hardware that's used to facilitate processing-intensive operations (3d graphics) and requires lots of computing power
Parallel Clusters	A type of parallel computing hardware. Can be Single Core Node Parallel, Multicore Node Parallel, and GPU Accelerated.
Multicore Parallel Programs	A type of parallel computing software that consists of one process, multiple threads (one per core), and shared data
Cluster Parallel Programs	A type of parallel computing software that consists of multiple processes (one per core), one thread per process, no thread sync issues, no shared data, and message passing
Multicore Clustered Parallel Programs	A type of parallel computing software that consists of multiple processes (one process per node), multiple threads per process, one thread per core, shared memory parallel programming within a node, and message passing between nodes
GPU Accelerated Programming	A type of parallel computing software where the CPU sets up input data into CPU memory, copies input data from CPU memory to GPU memory, executes a computational kernel, copies output data from GPU mem to CPU mem, and reports results
Strong Scaling	A type of scaling in parallel computing that details how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed total problem size.
Weak Scaling	The scaled speedup increases linearly with respect to the number of processors and there is no limit for the scaled speedup (also known as Gustafson's law)
